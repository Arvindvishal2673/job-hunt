"""ReflectionAgent: implements the Observe-Reason-Act (ReAct) loop.

After each search round, this agent observes the collected job listings,
reasons about their quality and relevance, and acts by either:
  - "done"   → results are good enough, proceed to vetting.
  - "refine" → generate better search queries and trigger another round.

This is the second genuinely agentic component. The LLM is not just
generating text; it is making a control-flow decision that affects
which code path runs next.

REFLECT_SYSTEM = """You are a critical job search quality evaluator operating in a ReAct (Reason + Act) loop.

You will be given:
1. The candidate's profile and original search queries.
2. A sample of job listings found so far.

Your task is to evaluate whether these results are relevant and sufficient.

You MUST respond with only a valid JSON object. No prose, no explanation outside the JSON.

Decision rules:
- Return "done" if: at least 10 listings were found AND most titles are relevant to the candidate's skills.
- Return "refine" if: fewer than 10 results, OR most titles are irrelevant (wrong domain/seniority), OR results are all from only one source.
- When refining, generate 3 NEW search queries that are different from the original ones. Be more specific or try alternative terminology.

Response format:
{
  "thought": "One sentence reasoning about the quality of results.",
  "action": "done" or "refine",
  "new_queries": ["query1", "query2", "query3"]  // only required when action is "refine"
